This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev).

ðŸ”Ž **Smart, Extensible Build Framework**

## Generate a data project

Run `npx nx g @domgen/nx-data:project <project>` to generate a data project.

> Full usage documentation <https://github.com/domgen/dgx-devops-nx-plugins/tree/develop/packages/nx-data#usage>

When using Nx, you can create multiple projects in the same workspace.

## Add Implicit Dependencies Between Projects

Data projects are not actually code projects, so there is no automatic relationship between them.

To set a dependency, add an `implicitDependencies` block to the project's `project.json` file.

```
{
  ...
  "implicitDependencies": ["<DependentProject>"]
}
```

## Build

Run `npx nx build my-app` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Understand your workspace

Run `npx nx dep-graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of your projects.
